* Vertical Scaling 
    * Optimize the Process and increase the throughput with the same resource.
    * Preparing before-hand during non-peak hours

* Resilence (Making System Robust from Failures)
    * keep Backups to avoid single point of failures  like Master Slave Architecture
    * Hire more chefs / resources to increase the horizontal scaling. 
    * It is like buying more machine to get the more work done. 
    
* Microservice Architecture
    *  Scalability is there as we divided the responsibilities and scaled individually accordingly
    

* Distributed Systems 
    *  Partitioning 
    * Routing the requests in a smarter way called Load Balancer 
    * Decoupling : Separating out the systems to handle the systems and their responsibilities more efficiently.
